# Password Strength Evaluator

This Python script evaluates the strength of a given password based on various factors such as length, the presence of special characters, digits, and uppercase letters. It also checks if the password contains common patterns that are often targeted by attackers.

## Features
- Password length analysis.
- Special character presence evaluation.
- Digit and uppercase letter count verification.
- Detection of common password patterns.
- Strength level assessment.
- Password recommendation generator.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install colorama`.
3. Run the script by executing `python password_eval.py`.
4. Enter the password you want to evaluate.

The script will provide you with a strength assessment of your password and, if common patterns are detected, will recommend a stronger password for your use.
